Instead, please report security issues via:

- **Email**: reach@customfit.ai
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Flutter SDK Vulnerability Report
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### üìã What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: SDK version, Flutter version, platform details
5. **Proof of Concept**: Code snippets or screenshots (if applicable)
6. **Suggested Fix**: Any ideas for remediation (optional)

### üèÜ Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the report

5. **Coordination**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you

## Security Features

### üîê Data Protection

#### Secure Storage
- Sensitive data is stored using `flutter_secure_storage`
- User preferences and session data are encrypted at rest
- API keys and tokens are never stored in plain text

#### Network Security
- All communications use HTTPS/TLS
- Certificate pinning support for enhanced security
- Request signing and validation
- Configurable timeout and retry policies

#### Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected and transmitted
- User data is anonymized where possible
- Configurable data collection levels

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Controls

#### User Consent
```dart
// Minimal data collection - use anonymous users
final user = CFUser.anonymousBuilder()
    .build(); // No PII collected

// Simply don't call trackEvent() if you don't want analytics
// await client?.trackEvent('event_name'); // Don't call this for no analytics
```

#### Data Retention
```dart
// Configure event storage limits
final config = CFConfig.builder('your-key')
    .setMaxStoredEvents(50)         // Limit stored events
    .setEventsQueueSize(50)         // Limit in-memory queue
    .build();
```

#### GDPR Compliance
```dart
// Clear all user data (GDPR Article 17 - Right to erasure)
await client?.clearAllUserData();

// Export user data (GDPR Article 20 - Right to data portability)
final userData = await client?.exportUserData();
```

### üîç Security Monitoring

#### Logging Security
- Sensitive data is never logged
- Debug logs are disabled in production builds
- Log levels are configurable per environment

#### Error Handling
- Errors don't expose sensitive information
- Stack traces are sanitized in production
- Graceful degradation on security failures

## Security Best Practices

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Guidelines

#### 1. API Key Management
```dart
// ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode API keys
final config = CFConfig.builder('hardcoded-key-here');

// ‚úÖ DO: Use environment variables or secure configuration
final apiKey = const String.fromEnvironment('CF_API_KEY');
final config = CFConfig.builder(apiKey);
```

#### 2. User Data Handling
```dart
// ‚ùå DON'T: Store PII unnecessarily
user.addStringProperty('ssn', '123-45-6789');
user.addStringProperty('credit_card', '4111111111111111');

// ‚úÖ DO: Use minimal, non-PII identifiers
user.addStringProperty('user_segment', 'premium');
user.addStringProperty('app_version', '1.2.3');
```

#### 3. Network Configuration
```dart
// ‚úÖ DO: Configure appropriate timeouts
final config = CFConfig.builder(apiKey)
    .setNetworkConnectionTimeoutMs(10000)  // 10 seconds
    .setNetworkReadTimeoutMs(15000)        // 15 seconds
    .build();
```

#### 4. Error Handling
```dart
// ‚úÖ DO: Handle errors gracefully without exposing internals
try {
  final value = await client?.getBoolean('feature_flag', false);
} catch (e) {
  // Log error internally, show generic message to user
  Logger.e('Feature flag evaluation failed', error: e);
  // Don't expose error details to end users
}
```

### üîí Certificate Pinning (Future Feature)
```dart
// Certificate pinning will be available in future releases
// for enhanced security in production deployments
```
